Come along to meet and network with like-minded filmmakers, actors, film financiers and indie-film marketing specialists. Whether you’re on the hunt for cast and crew, new projects, or are looking to explore your financing and marketing options, this is the perfect time and place to discuss all your current and future projects, with a drink in your hand and some great company! We welcome everyone to attend, whether you’re a filmmaker with heaps of experience, a film lover, or are completely new to the industry.

There will also be a pitching advice session and competition open to all filmmakers and creatives. You'll have the chance to pitch your film idea to other fellow filmmakers and gain some valuable advice and feedback.

The winner of the best pitch of the evening will win a full film crowdfunding course worth over £200.
