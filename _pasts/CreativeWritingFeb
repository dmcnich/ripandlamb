Ever dreamed of writing your own story but felt too nervous to put pen to page?

Join us for Unleash your Creative Writing where we'll let go of the idea of 'right and wrong' in storytelling and have fun developing plots and characters.

Tea, coffee and cake will be on sale to help curb that writers' block...
