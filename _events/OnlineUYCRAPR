Ever dreamed of writing your own story but felt too nervous to put pen to page?

Join us for Unleash your Creative Writing where we'll let go of the idea of 'right and wrong' in storytelling and have fun developing plots and characters.

The session will run in the same way as usual but via Zoom from the comfort of your own homes. Zoom invites will be sent out to all ticket holders on the day of the workshop. Please have pen and paper to hand during the session.

Tickets cost Â£5 per person and can be purchased
