Ripley and Lambert opened on Saturday 20th July 2019.

Born of a passionate love of film and a belief that reading about film expands and deepens the experience, Ripley and Lambert is a place for all film fans, from the casual cinemagoer to the enthusiast, the film student and the industry professional.  Our carefully selected range of books aims to cover a wide range of film and television topics.  And you can soak up the film vibe in one of our three distinctive spaces, whether the elegant surroundings of the front room, the quiet retro charm of the back room or the cosy and calm atmosphere of the basement.

The founder/owner Catherine Staples, a born and bred Londoner, has worked in a number of areas of the film industry, including three years in renowned film laboratories Todd-AO and Soho Film Lab (later to become Deluxe Soho) and three years working as a freelance camera assistant on a number of films and television programs including The Hour, Merlin, Misfits, In Fear and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.  She also spent a number of years working at the Prince Charles Cinema in central London, still one of her favourite cinemas, and prior to opening Ripley and Lambert she worked as the Finance Manager at Isledon Arts CIC, a company that runs youth hubs in Islington and provides room hire and catering services at their sites.

With this experience, and the aforementioned deep love of film, the long gestating idea for Ripley and Lambert became a plan and then found a home at 542 Kingsland Road, formerly a hair and beauty salon.  With a team of professionals and enthusiastic family and friends, the site became the Ripley and Lambert we know and love today!
